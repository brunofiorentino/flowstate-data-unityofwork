# Flowstate.Data.UnityOfWork

Flowstate.Data.UnityOfWork is a small C# library that provides simple abstractions to manage the unit of application layer worker instances, while repository implementations have full access to managed data persistence components. There is a built-in implementation based on `System.Data.Common` components, which exposes managed connections and transactions through a simple interface.
