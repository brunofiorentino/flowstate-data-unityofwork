# Flowstate.Data.UnityOfWork

Flowstate.Data.UnityOfWork is a small C# library that provides simple abstractions to manage an unit of work instance from the application layer while repository instances have full access to contextual, shared data persistence components. There is a built-in implementation based on `System.Data.Common` components which exposes managed connections and transactions through a simple interface.
